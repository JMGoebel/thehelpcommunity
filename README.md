# The Help Community

### Overview
The Help Community site allows individual users to set up community volunteer events.  Users can both set up events and join events others have already set up.  An example of an event might be to get a group of people together to help do yard work for the elderly or disabled or to go clean a local park that has been neglected.  The overall goal is to help build better communities via positive voluntary action. 

### Features
- **User Accounts** - Users can register a new account, and sign-in and out.
- **User Profiles** - Users will have editable profiles that allow easy access to relevent information.
- **Events** - Users can create, edit, join, or follow events.
- **Search** - Events can be searched for by type and/or location.
- **Comments** - Each event will have a sigle threaded comment section.

### What I'll Have to Learn
I already know a fair amount of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I am currently learning React.  It will take time to learn the rest of the MERN Stack; MongoDB, Express, and Node.js.  To sum it up, I have to learn the back-end.
